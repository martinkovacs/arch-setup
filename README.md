# Arch Linux setup script
Primarily this is for my use, but you can modify it, how you want. You can add or delete package names, files, etc.

# Usage
 - Add or delete package names inside of each category.
 - Edit `999-full-install.sh` to include the categories you want.
 - Then run `./999-full-install.sh <your choice of DE>` (currently just `xfce`, `plasma`, or `gnome`)

# Inspired by
These scripts are strongly inspired by Erik Dubois, the creator of ArcoLinux.
